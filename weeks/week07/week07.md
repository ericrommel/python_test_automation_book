Regular expressions are powerful tools for matching, searching, and manipulating text. They are widely used in data validation, parsing, and text processing. Now suppose you need to write Python code to find out whether a log record contains the substring 'HttpStatusCode: xxx' where http code can be any three consecutive decimal digit characters.

```python
log_record = "some text HttpStatusCode: 202 some text"
```
