# Week 1: Python Basics, Control Structures, and Functions in Test Scripts

## Introduction

In this session, we will start by covering essential Python fundamentals, including **variables**, **data types**, and **operators**, which are critical for understanding how control structures and functions work in test scripts. We will also ensure all necessary tools are installed and set up.

### What You Will Learn:
- Python variables and data types.
- Main operators for calculations and comparisons.
- How to use control structures (if-else, loops) in test scripts.
- How to define and use functions to modularize and reuse test code.
