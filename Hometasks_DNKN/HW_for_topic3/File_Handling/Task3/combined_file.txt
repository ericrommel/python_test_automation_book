Out on the tar plains
The glides are moving
All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me
So newly charming
Sweating dew drops glisten fresh in your side
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
Way down the lane away
Living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim seagull in the sky
Towards that hollow western Isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
Sing, Blue Silver
And watching lovers part
I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes
With a thought to stiffen brooding lies
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
Sing, Blue Silver
Sing, Sing Blue Silver
