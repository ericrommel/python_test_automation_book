## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a new feature integration between Bank XYZ’s existing wealth management platform and BlackRock’s Wealth Management API. The primary function of this feature is to analyze portfolio sector concentrations, compare them against predefined BlackRock threshold percentages, and trigger alerts for Financial Advisors when these thresholds are exceeded. This capability aims to preemptively identify and mitigate potential risks due to overconcentration in specific market sectors.


## 2. Objective

To develop and integrate a feature that utilizes BlackRock’s API to analyze sector concentration within Bank XYZ’s client portfolios, ensuring proactive risk management by alerting Financial Advisors about potential overexposures. This feature will enhance portfolio management strategies and contribute to minimizing potential losses from anticipated sector movements.


## 3. Target Users

- Financial Advisors at Bank XYZ
- Risk Management Teams
- Backend Integration Developers


## 4. Features and User Stories

### Feature 1: Sector Concentration Analysis

#### User Story: As a Financial Advisor, I want to easily analyze if client portfolios are overconcentrated in any specific sector over a chosen time range to maintain diversified investment strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

Financial Advisors can select client portfolios and specify time ranges for analysis.

The system retrieves portfolio data and sends it to the BlackRock API for sector concentration analysis.

The analysis results, including sector concentration percentages, are displayed on the Financial Advisor’s dashboard.


### Feature 2: Threshold Rule Configuration

#### User Story: As a Risk Management Officer, I need to define and adjust the threshold percentages for sector concentration that trigger alerts to Financial Advisors to reflect our evolving risk management policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

Risk Management Officers can access a configuration panel to set and adjust sector concentration threshold percentages.

The system stores and applies these thresholds when analyzing portfolio sector concentrations.

Any changes in threshold settings are logged and can be reviewed by authorized personnel.


### Feature 3: Automated Alert System for Financial Advisors

#### User Story: As a Financial Advisor, I want to receive immediate alerts if any of my managed portfolios exceed the BlackRock rule threshold for sector concentration so I can take timely action to rebalance portfolios and mitigate risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

When sector concentration exceeds the threshold percentage set by the Risk Management team, an alert is generated and sent to the respective Financial Advisor.

Alerts include details about the affected portfolio, the specific sector, the current concentration percentage, and the threshold exceeded.

Financial Advisors can view a history of alerts received for their managed portfolios.


## 5. Non-functional Requirements

### Security

Ensure secure data transmission between Bank XYZ and BlackRock’s API.

Implement role-based access control for the threshold configuration panel.


### Performance

Analysis and alert generation should occur in real time, with a maximum latency of 5 seconds from data retrieval to alert delivery.


### Scalability

The system must support analysis and alerting for up to 10,000 portfolios concurrently.


## 6. Conclusion

Integrating this feature with BlackRock’s Wealth Management API provides Bank XYZ with a powerful tool for proactive risk management. By monitoring sector concentrations and adhering to set threshold rules, Financial Advisors can better safeguard client investments against potential market volatilities.
